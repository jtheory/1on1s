# Code of conduct

Simple, because this is a simple & focused project.

Contributions are welcome from everyone, including issues, PRs, and discussion.

We do not tolerate abuse, discrimination, harassment, or even getting a little too personal in a debate.

Seriously, phrases like "only an idiot would think that..." are going to be a problem.

Kindness & respect is required.

## Reporting an issue

- Email to conduct@jtheory.com, anonymously is fine (use a throwaway email)
- Include links to the abusive behavior, or if it's in private communication, other evidence and context

Reports will be kept confidential.

The complainant's identity will be kept confidential from the reported person, assuming that's possible.

## What next

I'll reply as soon as possible (normally that day), review the report, and possibly request more info before taking any action.

Possible actions:

- Banning a contributor
- Private warning for really very trivial issues / misunderstandings, though tolerance here is still very low
- No action if a review turns out there was a true misunderstanding / misreading

It's okay to make a report without being sure of a problem. I'll try to sort it out either way.

## Recourse

If you've been banned from the project and don't think it was fair: you can also email conduct@jtheory.com to discuss.

## Future versions

I'll update & expand this code if this project begins to develop an active community and needs a more thorough code.
