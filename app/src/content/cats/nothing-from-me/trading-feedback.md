# Have we traded feedback recently?

Safe, non-urgent feedback on things we've noticed _before_ there's any real problem is really valuable.

It creates the habit of sharing & tuning how we work & interact, collaboratively.

It also helps correct bad interpretations early (and no one is perfect at guessing others' motivations).

## Don't forget to _get_ feedback, too

> So... got any awkward feedback for me, since last time?
>
> It's okay if it might not be really fixable, or it's minor; at least then I'll know.  
> You might save me some real trouble and help me correct something early.

Another angle:

> We talk about lots of different things on some of these calls; basically I'm guessing about what'll be useful to you.
>
> I'll definitely guess wrong sometimes, though.
>
> If I know about what times you're just thinking "I hope this wraps up soon, because I have stuff to do" then I'll absolutely shift the focus into better directions.

## And don't forget positive feedback!

It's hugely useful to wrap up 1-on-1s once a month or so by taking notes together on what they've learned & accomplished with the team; collect the stats & make it really clear what the benefit was.
