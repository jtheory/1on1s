# I'm unsure how your work is going

1-on-1 calls are not for work status updates.

They **are** a fine time for us to brainstorm on how to improve our process, though!

Let's talk about the goals of sharing status, and then figure out the most comfortable way to do that, for you & me in particular.

Lots of our work naturally involves writing things down; that helps. More time (and focus) spent on extra documentation _just_ to share status is tedious.

Check who's using that info (and what do they do with it?) so we aren't wasting time on unpleasant tasks.

> Product needs some sense of how it's going, because if they're thinking "quick tweak" and it's turning into "tear this apart & rebuild" they need to re-evaluate. But they don't need details if all is well.
>
> For simple stuff we all understand, the rest of us on the team don't need much, really beyond ticket status, really, assuming you're pairing on & off.
>
> Mostly we want to catch each other if we're overlapping (but not pairing), if we hit unexpected problems, or if we're changing the platform.
>
> Let's take an example and figure out how that can work.
