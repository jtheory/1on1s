# You know all this better than I do

It can feel risky at first to "manage" someone who's more experienced than I am, or who is already doing all the things I might coach them on.

Can I support someone doing something I've never done?

Can I help them get to a career stage I've not been to, personally?

## Actually: yes

As usual: just find a way to talk about this directly... especially because a manager absolutely **can** sabotage an experienced IC; it's crucial to avoid "boss" mode and focus on collaboration & support.

It's surprisingly useful to:

- take notes & map out their plans
- let them pick the next concrete steps
- review & update notes & actions periodically
- unblock when needed

Plus, the fact that they **can** do something does not mean they should.

- collect and share context (including appreciation & worries) from other parts of the company they might not have seen
- learn how they work, and protect their focus time & flow
- remind them to (& make sure they can) carve out time to focus on non-urgent but important thinking time & projects

## More eyes make bugs shallow (including planning bugs)

We all have blind spots, also. An experienced IC (and often less-experienced ICs) will often have valuable insight into anything we're trying to with the team & project; and we can likewise sometimes help them catch a gap in their own plans or priorities.
