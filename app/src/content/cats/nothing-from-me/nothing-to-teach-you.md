# You know all this better than I do

It can feel risky at first to "manage" someone who's more experienced than I am, or who is already doing all the things I'd normally help with.

Can I support someone doing something I've never done?

Can I help them get to a career stage I've not been to, personally?

## Actually: yes

As usual: just find a way to talk about this directly... especially because a manager absolutely **can** sabotage an experienced IC; it's urgent to avoid "boss" mode and just collaborate & support.

It's surprisingly useful to just:

- take notes & map out their plans
- let them pick the next concrete steps
- review & update notes & actions periodically
- unblock when needed

## More minds make better work

We all have blind spots, also. An experienced IC (and even less-experienced ICs) will often have valuable insight anything we're trying to do on the team, with the project; and we can likewise sometimes help them catch a gap in their own plans or priorities.
