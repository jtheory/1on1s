# Don't ever skip, really

A 10-minute call might be all you need; but really **don't ever skip** 1-on-1s, especially when you're working remotely.

It's fairly standard to start out with weekly 1-on-1s (of maybe 45 minutes), then maybe switch to every other week if the team & work is stable and humming along nicely.

Less frequently than that is risky, though it doesn't _feel_ like a risk, often.

## Trade feedback

> So... got any awkward feedback for me, since last time?  
> It's okay if I maybe can't actually fix it, or it's minor; at least then I'll know.  
> If we talk about it while it's minor, we might save ourselves from it getting worse....

And don't forget positive feedback!

It's hugely useful to wrap up 1-on-1s once a month or so by taking notes together on what they've learned & accomplished with the team; collect the stats & make it really clear what the benefit was.

## What about evaluation?

If part of your job is judging their performance, how do you do that?

**When** do you do it?

You have to do it, at least a little bit, before every 1 on 1, because it's so much easier to work with someone on a problem when it's little and you have time.

If you don't notice it for months... you might cost someone their job and/or a lot of pain.
