# Don't ever miss a 1-on-1

A 10-minute call might be all we need; but really **let's not ever skip** 1-on-1s, especially when we're working remotely.

It's fairly standard to start out with weekly 1-on-1s (of maybe 45 minutes), then maybe switch to every other week if the team & work is stable and humming along nicely. It helps if we pick a time that's a natural break: near lunch or after stand-up, maybe.

Less frequently than that is risky, though it doesn't _feel_ like a risk.

But everyone thinks differently, and we can be taken by surprise that someone has been struggling, but didn't think to say anything.

## What about evaluation?

If part of your job is judging their performance, how do you do that (specifically)?

**When** do you do it?

Think about it at least a little before every 1-on-1, because it's **so much** easier to work with a problem when it's minor and you have time.

If you don't notice it for months, until it's a serious problem and affecting many other people... you might cost someone their job and cause a lot of unnecessary pain.

## And what about appreciation?

Evaluation is about showing them where they are. If they're doing great, what specifically are they doing, and what's great about it?
