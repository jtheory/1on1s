# Step back & talk about career paths

Do we have a documented career ladder for the org?

If not, we can reference shared ones, like https://career-ladders.dev, as part of finding out what skills you most want to develop, and how to do that.

Everyone has different strengths; we want to make sure the baseline skills (especially around working effectively with the team & company) are solid, but also make sure you're getting to do things that play to & grow your strengths and what you like best.

> Are any of these things intimidating, and we can make some safe experiments in that direction so they're more familiar?  
>  
> In a given week, what are the moments where you most enjoy & feel like you're really in the zone? What are the hardest moments, or where you feel lost or unsure?

## I want to do things we aren't doing here...

Tech you want to explore that we aren't using? Skills that aren't really relevant to our project?

Do you want to try leading a team, and you're ready to do that, but we're not adding teams here?

It's good to find out, and sometimes it can make sense to help someone jump to another part of the org, or even leave the company on good terms.

If I know about it, we can plan a smart transition. If I don't have a clue, it's really hard to say when they'll give notice.
