# Step back & talk about career paths

Do we have a documented career ladder for the org?

If not, let's talk about shared ones, like [progression.fyi](https://www.progression.fyi) or [career-ladders.dev](https://career-ladders.dev), as part of finding out what skills you want to develop, and how.

Everyone has different strengths; we want to make sure baseline skills (especially around working effectively with the team & company) are solid, but also make sure you're getting to do things that let you use and build on your strengths.

> Are any of these things intimidating, and we can run some experiments in that direction to start learning the territory?
>
> In a given week, what are the moments you most enjoy & feel like you're really in the zone? What are the hardest moments, or where you feel lost or unsure?
>
> Another way to think of it: there's a sweet spot in between "fully comfortable" and "in over my head" where you are fully engaged and actively sharpening your skills. You need to take some risks to get there, but you knmow it when you're there. What blocks you from getting here, now?

## I want to do things we aren't doing here...

Tech you want to explore that we aren't using? Skills that aren't really relevant to our roadmap?

Do you want to try leading a team, and you're ready to do that, but we're not starting new teams now?

It's good to find out, and sometimes it can make sense to help someone jump to another part of the org, or even leave the company on good terms.

If I know about it, we can plan a smart transition. If I don't have a clue, it's more chaotic (but not a disaster, to be honest).
