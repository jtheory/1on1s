# What's happening outside our project & team?

There should be other ways that we're all connected to the rest of the company, not via 1-on-1s.

But do you have sensitive questions that no one is answering? (like: how stable are we financially? What happens, really, if this project fails or takes an extra 3 weeks?)

Ideas that no one else is talking about? Let's figure out how & where you can raise those.

The higher the autonomy of a team and its engineers, the more they will need to understand:

* the value of their work, and how that is measured
* company strategy and how their work fits in
* the process of setting priorities and evaluating the team's work

It's fairly healthy if they are a little uneasy wondering if the team is working on the right things,
and want more insights into:

* how sales & support are talking about their work
* what users are happy about or frustrated by (or not even discovering)
* updates from leadership

It's the responsibility of product managers, engineering managers, and higher leadership to bring that context
(and coordinate with engineers to improve analytics & observability where needed).
