# Log accomplishments & learnings

> I'm really happy with how everything's going; both what you're building and the personal stuff.  
> What's your sense of it?
>
> Are you keeping track anywhere of your wins? If you want, we can try logging them now.
>
> It's really useful to be able to look back after a year or so and see what we've done,
> both what we've created & problems solved, but what new things we're capable of.

I share running notes from 1-on-1s; it works to just drop in an accomplishments section every month or two.
