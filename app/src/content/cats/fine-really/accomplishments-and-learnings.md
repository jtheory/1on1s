# Log accomplishments & learnings

> I'm really happy with how everything's going; both what you're building and the human side.
> What's your sense of it?
>
> Are you keeping track anywhere of your wins? If you want, we can write out some notes today.
>
> It's really useful to be able to look back after a year or so and see what we've done,
> both what we've created & problems solved, but what new things we're capable of.

I share running notes from 1-on-1s; it works to just drop in an accomplishments section every month or two.

Data-focused is ideal (some way to measure the value), but not required.

It serves both of us:

- They can confirm & review what they're learning & achieving here, and update their resume now & then
- For a performance review or promotion doc, it's **really easy** to scan through these.
