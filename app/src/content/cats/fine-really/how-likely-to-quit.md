# How likely are you to quit?

It's common to **not** tell your manager or lead that you're looking for other jobs.

## Should I ask? Not ask?

Definitely can't force it; that's okay. Still... if I _know_ a dev is likely to leave soon, it would be so useful...
Hiring & on-boarding a replacement can definitely take longer than their notice period; they could double-down on mentoring now, etc..

But it's a risk for them to share. Suppose they don't find any great options and stay... but I've just picked someone else to lead something new & exciting?

The best I can do is to make it **valuable** to be open with me.

This might mean:

1. I can be a strong reference, and can also look for opportunities in my networks
1. I can help you weigh what's important; compensation vs. mission vs. autonomy vs. work-life integration vs. ...
1. I can help optimize your CV (logging wins is already helping)
1. I can be open about upcoming plans & possibilities internally (and whatever decisions we're making that involve you)
1. We can coordinate a smooth handover
1. And no bridges will be burned; it leaves the door open for you to come back, if that's a good option sometime

> I'm really happy with the work you've been doing; and it feels like you're pretty well-placed here for this stage in your career.
>
> But listen: I know opportunities can come up, and there may be things you're hunting for that we just can't provide. If you can keep me somewhat in the loop, there's a lot I can do to help out, and it'd make that an easier transition.
>
> Also, if you're not looking yet but getting that feeling... let me know. We get wrapped up in everything; if I'm guessing wrong about how you're doing, I won't do stuff I **could** do to help.

## Share context

One of the reasons people leave is because they don't realize what they're taking for granted, or what's coming up that'll be specifically valuable for them.

There may also be much more flexibility than they realize; there can be new teams being created soon, new projects coming up, and even roadmap changes that are possible **simply because** enough people want to work on a particular technology or type of project, and it's possible to find the overlap between those interests & the company mission.
