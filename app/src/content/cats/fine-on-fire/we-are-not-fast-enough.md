# We're just not going fast enough

This is a crucial topic when the team is struggling and deadlines are looming.

There are so many bad paths to take, and some of them will do serious damage to team members, the company as a whole, or (probably) both.

Less experienced devs still have awful habits left over from school; _burn everything_ and fall over the finish line, then crash. Or they may believe think bosses will only assign them reasonable tasks, so either they _must_ succeed to prove themselves, or they will fail out of adult life.

Others will just check out. "There's no way we'll make this deadline... typical. I'm going to just do the minimum to keep my job, and ignore whatever the bosses feel like shouting about today; there's no point."

## What's a healthier mental model?

Whether the deadlines are impossible or even _too_ easy & safe, a team still optimizes in the same way:

* Team well-being & good mental health is first. We need our brains for quality work, and brains do not function well in flaming wreckage.
* Everyone on the team knows what actual value we're creating
* We experiment & make changes to avoid burning away our energy on anything **else**, like work politics, lost focus, bad communication.

If we're motivated & focused after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's get her vision updates in a few weeks.

If we're discouraged & panicked after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's NOT do that; we can stay informed some other way.

If we're oblivious to whether we'll hit a deadline or not, let's front-load riskier work, invest some time in partial estimates, and make sure it's known.

Does it work well to have semi-weekly showcases, where we tour through our progress? Or does it ...not really speed us up, and just takes too long to prep?

If we're dragging because no one on the team has deep experience in a required tech, let's find out our options. Training, help internally or from a consultant, increased timeline for deep dives, hiring?

...All of these need us to be alert, aware, and communicating well. The answers will vary for different teams.

**Deadlines do not change how an effective team operates.** They can be motivational and focus work. They can also guide decisions around technical debt; it can be fine to alternate focused delivery periods with more exploratory and/or refactoring-focused periods.

But in the end, it's still up to the team to work in a sustainable & effective way.
