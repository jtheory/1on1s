# They have feedback, but I don't agree

We ask for feedback about our work, and sometimes we'll get it, but...

They're suggesting a change that doesn't match how we work best.

They're saying something we did or said is a problem, but it's normal! Everyone does this! No one has ever complained!

**Wait; don't argue.** It's awkward & _risky_ to give feedback to a lead or manager.

The problem might not be exactly what they're saying, or we're not seeing it clearly yet, but there's _definitely something important here._

## Take notes now & process later

> I'm not sure I get it fully, yet; I'm going to write this down, so I can think it through properly after the call; is that okay?
>
> That means I'm not doing anything useful yet; but we can pick it up again (choose day/time)

Ways to clarify:

- (For a suggested change:) what are the issues that this is fixing?
- Is there a recent specific example on your mind?
- How often does this happen (in real terms)? E.g. times per day/week
- What's the cost / fallout? Not just concrete (wasted time, missed communication) but also energy/emotional (angry, frustrated, demotivated, anxious), and for how long?
- Who else is affected?

Emotional reactions are individual, so "that wouldn't bother me" isn't relevant at all.

Intent also isn't relevant (though it's nice to know).

We just need to find out what's happening, or what they think can be better, and why.

## Good feedback that's not delivered perfectly is still good

Sometimes people might overstate a problem, because their quieter complaints were ignored (here or elsewhere).

Sometimes they'll shrink it: "oh, this isn't a big deal; and it probably isn't what you meant, but..."

Sometimes they'll get some details wrong, but the _rest_ of the complaint is valid.

Extract the valuable parts; we're not building a defense, we're collaborating & merging ideas to get better.

## Follow up clearly & collaborate

The first step is _figuring out_ options, including the not-very-good options (which might include: "do nothing for now; check back next 1-on-1").

Once we have a map (and have both shared the context we see), we can decide together what path to take.
