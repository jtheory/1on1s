# Overreacting or defensiveness (or other trauma signs)

Sometimes people react with strong emotions (or... go silent & hide them) in the face of what seem like minor negative interactions.

There's a project setback, a mistake to be fixed, a higher-up is critical of something.

If someone's reaction just isn't what I expected at all, then probably they're seeing patterns that led to serious problems in the past.

(I can also ask if there's anything happening that stresses them out, if I'm not sure).

## The details aren't my business

It's important to talk about the interaction (and negative side-effects), and find out how to improve things, but maybe **not** good to probe into their actual history & the reasons.

> It looked like you were pretty upset this morning, and that seemed worth talking about. That shouldn't be a normal experience at work.
>
> I have some sense of this; I've had bad experiences in past jobs, or going on outside of work, and can get into a conversation now where it just **feels** awful, because of that history.
>
> Listen, details of your history of life outside work are none of my business.
>
> But maybe we can find a way to stop that happening.

## I'm not a therapist

Even if I had that training (I do not) that's still not a good role for a manager to fill.

Knowing all about their private struggles means I have to be 100% sure that won't bias me in some way (could I feel overprotective, and also ...assume they're not ready for a promotion?).

It's better to focus on direct support (plus whatever extra support the company offers).

## Collaborate to help, not "fix" it for them

Especially if our reactions were really different, intervening ("I talked to X directly about this for you!") might not be at all what they want; gotta find out.

We can collaborate on what to do; they need to be in the loop (and the ideal for minor communication issues is to make sure they know they're supported, and let them handle corrective conversations on their own).
