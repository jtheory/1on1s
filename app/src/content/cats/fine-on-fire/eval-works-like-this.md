# Evaluation works like this, but I don't like it

Engineering managers don't just decide on their own how to evaluate the team.

There's a system (maybe unwritten, or only partly documented) around performance, and how eval works.

The most important part in a 1-on-1 is to _expose_ how eval works (and how it's going), not just give our own opinions.

If a team member is doing valuable, challenging work e.g. mentoring or building cross-team bridges, but a VP swoops in with "I just checked X's commit history... this is unacceptable; they aren't contributing enough", then that's pretty bad. If a good eval, here, means a steady stream of commits, then as a manager, I'm harming the team member if they don't know that.
