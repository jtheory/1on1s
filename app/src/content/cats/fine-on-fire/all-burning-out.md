# We are all burning out!

Everyone is working way too many hours, because we worry the company won't survive if we don't deliver.

Maybe... we **did** deliver, sort of, and since then we've been battling on but half-drowning in the bugs, the performance issues, the instability.

A blame-focused work culture, poor communication and wasted work or resources all make it worse.

## What's going to happen?

Some devs will leave on their own (often: the highly-skilled & extroverted; they have friends asking them why they're putting up with a death march).

Others will stay, in spite of the damage it's doing, because they fear failure or "giving up", they don't want to abandon the team, they think there will one day be rewards to match the pain and effort; or other reasons.

But overwork sabotages mental & physical health. Personal life & relationships suffer. People's careers can stall completely, or if they're still learning, it's by grueling trial & error with little time to reflect... the slowest way.

At some point, the damage will overwhelm their ability to work at all, and recovery may take months or years.

## How do we talk about it?

1. Define a practical healthy working environment as a reference (mental well-being, flexibility, high-quality work & collaboration, carefully-managed complexity & technical debt), and highlight what we _do_ have vs. where we're currently falling short.
1. Get updates: how often working into the night, how often upset about work, how often work demands are clashing with life outside of work. **We don't need details**, especially if trust is low! Just a sense of e.g. how this week compares to last week, and if there are particular things happening that make it worse.
1. Talk about and get input on long-term fixes. How aware is leadership of what's happening? Share what you've said & heard.

> We have a lot to fix, long-term, but... what _small_ change would make your life just a little bit better, that we can try right now?  
> Even freeing you from 10 minutes of annoyance gives you 10 minutes to think clearly about larger strategy...
>
> Let's assign tasks - I'll do X, you do Y; and we'll review results on the 20th.
