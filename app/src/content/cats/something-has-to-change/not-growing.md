# Not advancing, or dropping off

So, someone is doing their work, and it's... fine; but they don't seem to be hungry to advance.

They're not learning outside of work, they don't seem to be interested in a promotion or seeking new challenges.

What can I do?

## Maybe I don't have to do anything

Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is more obvious, but even in normal times, sometimes people's extra energy is needed elsewhere.

It's true: they're not going to have a breakthrough at work; they're not going to get a promotion or take on more responsibilities.

They may need extra time off; they may need a leave of absence entirely, or they may need to just keep moving and do the role they have.

We're still a business, so there are limits to how flexible we can be: discuss with leadership & other managers to be consistent with what we can offer.

## They do need clear communication

It's awful to tell someone who's burning out, who's struggling with a crumbling relationship or a sick toddler or hospitalized or dying family members that... surprise, they have **not** been doing the minimum, and now they are fired.

There needs to be a clear level at which yes, this is enough to keep going (and look forward to better times) vs. no, this will not be enough and your job is at risk.

We need to collaborate on keeping this clarity year-round, not just at review periods.

## What if their work is really slipping?

Here are the main paths:

1. Realize after 6 months that this person is now only doing maybe 60% of the minimum. The company has already lost that salary. We likely cannot save their job, and there's strong pressure to get them out as soon as possible; the worst possible result for everyone.
1. Realize after 2 weeks that someone who has been doing well is slipping; nothing has been lost yet, and you can start talking immediately about options.

There are a lot of reasonable options, if there's not already a painful cost (already lost productivity/salary) to account for.

- Move to part-time or reduced hours
- Change focus or even change roles (voluntary demotion)
- Maybe the company has more options to support them during a bad time
- Figure out smarter ways to use holiday or take unpaid leave
- Keep communication open while they hunt for different work
