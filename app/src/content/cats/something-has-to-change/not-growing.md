# Not advancing, or maybe slowing down

So, someone is doing their work, and it's... fine; but they don't seem to be hungry to advance.

They're not learning outside of work, they don't seem to be interested in a promotion or seeking new challenges.

What can I do?

## Maybe I don't have to do anything

Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is more obvious, but even in normal times, sometimes people's extra energy is needed elsewhere.

It's true: they're not going to have a breakthrough at work; they're not going to get a promotion or take on more responsibilities.

They may need extra time off; they may need a leave of absence entirely, or they may need to just keep moving and do the role they have.

A business still has practical limits on support they can offer, _but_ it's also expensive to replace someone, both financially and in team morale: discuss with leadership & other managers to be consistent with what we can offer.

## They do need clear communication

It's awful to tell someone who's burning out, who's struggling with a crumbling relationship or a sick toddler or hospitalized or dying family members that... surprise, they have **not** been doing the minimum, and now they are fired.

There needs to be a clear level at which yes, this is enough to keep going (and look forward to better times) vs. no, this will not be enough and your job is at risk.

We need to collaborate on keeping this clarity year-round, not just at review periods.

## What if their work is really slipping?

Here are the common paths:

1. Realize after months that this person is now only doing maybe half of the minimum. The company has already lost that salary. We likely cannot save their job, and there's now strong pressure to get them out as soon as possible; the worst possible result for everyone.
1. Realize after 2 weeks that someone's work quality has changed, and you have some worries; nothing has been lost yet, and we can start talking immediately about options — including how much flex the company allows.

There are a lot of possible options, if there's not already a painful cost (already lost productivity/salary) to account for.

- Move to part-time or reduced hours
- Change focus or even change roles (voluntary down-leveling)
- Figure out better ways to use holiday or unpaid leave
- Keep communication open while they hunt for different work without needing to panic
- ...whatever other support the company can offer to get through: child or elder care support, counseling, coaching or training, etc.

## How do I talk about this?

It may just come up in the usual catch-up. But maybe not: anyone who's worked in a more toxic environment may feel it's a risk to attract blame.

> Is your work moving along okay, generally?
>
> Getting stuck anywhere, or is there anything causing problems in the team? Stuff outside work throwing you off?

If they've not brought it up:

> I do have a few worries I want to go through; for right now, I just have a few notes.
>
> I figured we'd go through my notes together so I could get your perspective.
>
> There might not even be a problem at all; I'll just bring up worries whenever I have them, instead of waiting to see if oh, okay, we're in trouble.

Then go through what I've noticed, leaving space for them to fill in their PoV as we go.

If there's a reason for a temporary change, and that's fine, then just take notes on what we expect to see, and explain that there are paths to try also, if this is not so short term.

## Wrapping up

Before the end of the call, we need:

- specific actions, written down (for both of us)
- with timelines (also specifically what we'll review) that are fairly near-term

If we're both too optimistic about how long a rough patch will last — as we usually want to be — let's find that out quickly, and take another path that'll have a better chance of working.
