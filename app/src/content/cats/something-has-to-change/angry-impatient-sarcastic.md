# Angry, impatient, sarcastic, pessimistic, condescending...

What do we do when a team member is too negative, and it's affecting the team?

First, anything sexist, racist, etc.; or sex-related comments are a problem. Even as jokes; even if everyone laughs. It's never 100% clear who's cringing silently.

But in less clear situations, we can talk to people & check for real impact; there's a lot of cultural variance, and friendly insults (among actual friends) or exaggerated pessimism may not actually be a problem.

This is partly a question of team composition, and what personalities mesh well.

## Psychological safety

Any comments that undercut psychological safety & engagement are a problem.

(Reference to psychological safety & effective teams, and Google's research here)

"Have a thick skin" is not a requirement for a developer role.

"Can accept any critique, even if it's worded badly" is valuable, but also not required (and not always possible).

We **do** all need the skills to:

- Avoid escalating disagreements into personal attacks
- Value & work on holding our team to a high standard without attacking & undermining each other

Human mistakes are inevitable, and it's not helpful to just **try harder** to be perfect because you're frightened of public shaming.

Instead, we want to keep evolving our systems & processes to keep us steady:

- Map out work before starting and highlight risks (and get diverse input)
- Design good tests & observability in CI, CD and live code
- Keep complexity low and all APIs clean. Flag & refactor unstable areas.
- Review early & often -- a solo developer opening a large PR with changes one one has seen yet is an antipattern.

## How to talk about it

> I'll tell you what I'm seeing, and you let me know your point of view.  
>  
> I think your motivation for pushing here is good; you want us to write good code.  
> So what I want to talk about is how we can get that result, but minimize upsetting people along the way.

Sometimes they simply disagree with the best way to motivate people & keep work quality high!

That's fine; still many paths open:

- Let's set the bar for quality together; we can agree on this as a team, and then if the "kinder" paths aren't working, you'll have a stronger argument.
- I have studies, articles & books to suggest.
- It's also possible you'll just be happier in a different company's culture; if that's true, then just follow our rules while you're here, and I can definitely help you out finding a new role elsewhere.
