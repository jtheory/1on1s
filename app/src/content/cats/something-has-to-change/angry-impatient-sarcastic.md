# Angry, impatient, sarcastic, pessimistic, condescending...

What do we do when a team member is too negative, and it's affecting the team?

First, anything sexist, racist, etc.; or sex-related comments are a problem. Even as jokes; even if everyone laughs. It's never 100% clear who's cringing silently.

But in less clear situations, we can talk to people & check for real impact; there's a lot of cultural variance, and friendly insults (among actual friends) or exaggerated pessimism may not actually be a problem.

This is partly a question of team composition, and what personalities mesh well.

## Psychological safety

Any comments that undercut psychological safety & engagement are a problem.

(Reference to psychological safety & effective teams; Google)

"Have a thick skin" is not a requirement for a developer role.

"Can accept any critique, even if it's worded badly" is valuable, but also not required (and not always possible).

We **do** all need the skills to:

- Avoid escalating disagreements into personal attacks
- Value & work on holding our team to a high standard without attacking & upsetting each other

Human mistakes are inevitable, and it's not helpful to just ... try harder to be perfect, because you're frightened of public shaming.

Instead, we want to keep evolving our systems & processes to make them robust:

- Map out work before starting and highlight risks (and get diverse input)
- Design good tests & observability in CI, CD and live code
- Keep complexity low and all APIs clean. Flag & refactor unstable areas.

## How to talk about it

> I'll tell you what I'm seeing, and you let me know your point of view.  
>  
> I think your motivation for pushing here is good; you want us to write good code.  
> So what I want to talk about is how we can get that result, but minimize upsetting people along the way.
