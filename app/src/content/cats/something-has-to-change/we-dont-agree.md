# We just don't agree on this

No problem; every disagreement is a chance for us to get better at collaboration & making good choices (sometimes: good guesses).

It's worth carefully steering intense disputes back to a shared discussion that's weighing importance, alternate paths, ease of changing course again, etc..

## Is this about the dev, and how they work?

Well, they're the expert on them.

If they want to work in a way that (I think) isn't the best, but they're still not harming the team & meeting reqs for their role: okay.

## About the team & shared process?

We have to choose together; it's important that the people who say their ideas the loudest don't just win out.

It's also important that a team lead or manager's opinion doesn't just override others' â€” let's just make sure we're structuring decisions well, and run options together as experiments.

Feed input from 1-on-1s back into team discussions (giving credit!); and most people will "disagree & commit" to experiments where it's clear that we'll change course if it's not working as hoped.
