# Inappropriate comments or actions; personal attacks or slurs

There are some cases where the slow & steady path, improving step-by-step and building new habits, just doesn't work.

The big exception is when there are other team members being harmed.

How much they're harmed is not always obvious. Some people can brush off advances or aggression and be relatively unbothered.

Others will act unbothered but are shaking & panicked in private, and rushing to find a way out of the company or the entire industry. Or just... exhausted, because they've been in a hundred similar situations already.

Their personal history is none of our business, really. They do not have to explain it & laboriously educate us.

We just to create an environment that's safe for everyone.

## Be ready with an instant reaction

People come from many backgrounds; some of them may have habits that are just not okay.

It's valuable not to attack someone who makes a mistake (and kick them into self-defence mode), but the mistake must be stopped immediately.

If no one says anything (even if there's a private response later), that establishes what's okay in the company culture.

Figuring out the right thing to say on the fly is really hard; so be ready in advance.

> Wait, what? That doesn't sound right. (Makes time to think of a more complete response if needed)  
>  
> I don't think this is a good joke. Can we move on to ___?  
>  
> I think we should stay away from comments about ___.  
>  
> PM: hey, this doesn't belong in a work chat: (link)

## Discuss quickly but calmly

It's okay if no one seemed offended; and there's no need for an angry debate or accusations; and I'm on the side of fixing this quickly so there's no further damage.

People make mistakes, and there are ways of interacting that are common in society, but that aren't fine in a modern workplace.

Generally, people can close the gap without too much trouble, as long as they actually understand why it's important.

> I wanted to talk about this right away, because it's dangerous territory.  
>  
> It shouldn't be a big deal as long as we can sort it out quickly.  
>  
> Company policy is strict, though, and this is not like making random mistakes in code.
