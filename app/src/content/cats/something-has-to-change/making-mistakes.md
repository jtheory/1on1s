# Making mistakes

## I made a mistake

This is where we model how we want everyone on the team to handle mistakes, so we'd better not:

- pretend it didn't happen or brush past it
- ignore our part in it, or focus on blaming other people or situations
- just "try harder": there are still root causes behind even "I guess I forgot that step", and we can make things safer

Instead, we need to put in some thought, talk through the actual results/costs, and also collect ideas from the team about how to address root causes.

2 main angles that can often be improved: reducing the damage when someone does make a similar mistake, and preventing it from happening in the first place.

## They made a mistake

It might be tempting to highlight the mistake, deliver some kind of scolding, extract a promise that it won't happen again, and move on.

What does that achieve, though, exactly?

Feelings of guilt & anxiety about getting caught in future mistakes costs quite a lot of energy, and also doesn't actually work very well.

This person is already less likely to make this mistake again. But what's best **for the team** is to figure out how to make the future safer.
