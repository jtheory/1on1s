# I'm worried your work isn't at the level we need

This is a hard one. Who feels comfortable telling someone that they're not good enough?

The important thing here is that this is **not** the judgement we have to make, anyway.

This is not an evaluation of the person, their worth, and not even of their ability to be a developer, generally.

To be really clear, I can't even say "the work you're doing isn't enough", just that what I'm seeing doesn't match up with what I think the team needs.

This sounds like it's splitting hairs, but it's important, because we're bad at guessing what other people are thinking.

So I need to be clear about:

1. What I'm seeing (and how I'm checking it)
1. Concrete expectations for this role (this should be clear across the organization, not criteria I'm inventing)
1. (...discussion & filling in context)
1. Possible paths & next steps

## Some problems have nothing to do with work

Personal life struggles can overwhelm work in a way people may not even notice.

> How stable is your life outside of work, right now?  
> The details are none of my business, but if things are rough right now, we can coordinate to try to keep work really stable.

## A good team and good developer can still be a poor match

Maybe their work is great but their communication style keeps upsetting the rest of the team.

Maybe they are incredibly detail-oriented & want everything just right, and the team needs to crank out many experiments, fast (and throw most of them away). Or vice versa.

Maybe the product complexity has grown to a level where they're struggling to work safely.

These are all cases where there are many paths:

- You may want to improve these skills
- You can maybe change focus (or change teams) to work the way you prefer
- The product itself may need arch refactoring and clean-up before more & more devs are forced to drop out
- Or maybe it's time to start looking for roles elsewhere; and we can plan this out

## Bring context & options, not threats or demands

If the conversations feels like a power or dominance struggle, that triggers all kind of instincts that will not help.

A manager's job is not to tell team members what to do or keep them in line.

It's to support them so that, with the team, they can succeed & build good things.

If I see a problem, I share the context we see with them, they share their side, and then we collaborate to make sure things get better.

If I suggest one solution, but they say "no, I really want to just do it this way, and we'll get the result we need", that's fine.

They know themselves better than I do. I just need to confirm how we'll confirm.

## Don't forget to leave space to think

It's highly stressful when work isn't going well. Many people don't give their best replies immediately in a worrying conversation.

> Think about it, both the options we talked about and what I can do to help.  
> If you have other ideas or suggestions, let me know! We'll make a concrete plan on Friday.
