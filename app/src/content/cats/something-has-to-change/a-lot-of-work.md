# This person takes all my energy

Sometimes people are productive, but only with far more attention & energy than anyone else.

They seem to need constant guidance, or they want to spend hours complaining about things or people, or they escalate disputes until someone else intervenes, or they go down rabbit holes until someone pulls them out.

If we keep doing this work, we have little energy left for anything & anyone else.

## Concrete data helps

They need some grounded context on what's happening, so it's possible to work on it.

If I'm irritated or frustrated, it's important to set that aside to **have** this conversation, but that's also part of the context.

- Interventions that are pretty easy have a time cost
- If they're _also_ unpleasant or difficult, that has a **time + energy** cost

Often the energy cost is a much bigger problem.

## I expose the problem; you own the fix

I've read a lot about time & focus management, communication style, and so on. I can share resources & suggestions!

Finding the approach that works is up to them.

I can also (still) help with minor interventions; that's fine! I also want to know if I'm ever making things harder.

## New habits & skills aren't fast, but they work

Changing habits is slow, but possible, especially with enough collaboration to keep each other on track long-term.

Perfection isn't the goal, just making sure the results in the real world are good enough.
