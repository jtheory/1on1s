# This person takes all my energy

Sometimes people are productive & doing the job, but only with far more attention & energy than anyone else.

They seem to need constant guidance, or they want to spend hours complaining about things or people, or they escalate disputes until someone else gets them back on track, or they go down rabbit holes until someone pulls them out.

If we just give them what they seem to need, we have little energy left to support the rest of the team & other work.

## Concrete data helps

They need some grounded context on what's happening, so it's possible to work on it.

If I'm irritated or frustrated, it's important to set that aside to **have** this conversation, but that's also part of the context.

- Interventions that are pretty easy to do have a time cost
- If they are _also_ unpleasant or difficult, that has a time + energy cost

Sometimes the energy cost is a much bigger problem.

> Here's what I see happening; you can fill in pieces I'm missing.  
>  
> Someone mentions an technical choice but you see a problem. You exaggerate the downsides, though.  
>  
> Then when they try to rebalance this or seem defensive, you escalate; eventually I see what's happening and have to dive in and defuse everything.  
>  
> Everyone is upset; you too, right? We've all lost half an hour, and defusing these things really burns me out... I have to drop everything and then try to unpick it all & redirect, then we end up having separate calls to calms everything down and somehow delicately make the original decision.
>  
> We need a path through here that feels like normal collaboration between the two of you.

## I expose the problem; you own the fix

I've read a lot about time & focus management, communication styles, and so on. I can share resources & suggestions!

Finding the approach that works is up to you.

I can also (still) help with minor interventions; that's fine! Let me know if anything I'm doing is actually making it harder.

## New habits & skills aren't instant, but they happen!

Changing habits is slow, but it works, especially with enough collaboration to keep each other on track long-term.

Perfection isn't the goal, just making sure the results in the real world are good enough.
