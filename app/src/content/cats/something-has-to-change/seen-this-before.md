# Oh, no... I've seen this before

Our instincts are pretty sharp about catching patterns that we've seen before.

Someone seems to be over-reacting to a mild critique, or being oddly secretive about their work, or not being honest about who did what.

Once we think we recognize a pattern, then lots of other clues start to point to the same conclusion.

This is a powerful tool for sniffing out problems, but it's common to leap to the wrong conclusion (and then get more & more convinced).

If multiple people are discuss someone else, they'll often reinforce that wrong idea even though there's no new info.

## Get back to direct observation, and find a way to talk about it

What's literally happening? How often? Do we have concrete details (if not: can we collect them from now on)?

Log what we actually know, and focus on bad results, not just questionable decisions.

> X's change caused this crash; X said on stand-up that they had no idea, but then quietly fixed it.
>
> There's a problem here with our tests not protecting us; that's first. We all code bugs sometimes.
>
> Fixing it was good; and the statement on standup didn't cause any new problems **except** that if we're not clear with each other it will waste time & erode trust.
>
> ...and there's some reason X felt unsafe admitting what had happened. I'll find out.
