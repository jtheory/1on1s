Still... if I _know_ a dev is likely to leave soon, it would be so useful...\nHiring & on-boarding a replacement can definitely take longer than their notice period; they could double-down on mentoring now, etc..\n\nBut it's a risk for them to share. Suppose they don't find any great options and stay... but I've just picked someone else to lead something new & exciting?\n\nThe best I can do is to make it **valuable** to be open with me.\n\nThis might mean:\n\n1. I can be a strong reference, and can also look for opportunities in my networks\n1. I can help you weigh what's important; compensation vs. mission vs. autonomy vs. work-life integration vs. ...\n1. I can help optimize your CV (logging wins is already helping)\n1. I can be open about upcoming plans & possibilities internally (and whatever decisions we're making that involve you)\n1. We can coordinate a smooth handover\n1. And no bridges will be burned; it leaves the door open for you to come back, if that's a good option sometime\n\n> I'm really happy with the work you've been doing; and it feels like you're pretty well-placed here for this stage in your career.\n>\n> But listen: I know opportunities can come up, and there may be things you're hunting for that we just can't provide. If you can keep me somewhat in the loop, there's a lot I can do to help out, and it'd make that an easier transition.\n>\n> Also, if you're not looking yet but getting that feeling... let me know. We get wrapped up in everything; if I'm guessing wrong about how you're doing, I won't do stuff I **could** do to help.\n\n## Share context\n\nOne of the reasons people leave is because they don't realize what they're taking for granted, or what's coming up that'll be specifically valuable for them.\n\nThere may also be much more flexibility than they realize; there can be new teams being created soon, new projects coming up, and even roadmap changes that are possible **simply because** enough people want to work on a particular technology or type of project, and it's possible to find the overlap between those interests & the company mission.\n"

Personal life & relationships suffer. People's careers can stall completely, or if they're still learning, it's by grueling trial & error with little time to reflect... the slowest way.\nt some point, the damage will overwhelm their ability to work at all, and recovery may take months or years.\n\n## How do we talk about it?\n\n1. Define a practical healthy working environment as a reference (mental well-being, flexibility, high-quality work & collaboration, carefully-managed complexity & technical debt), and highlight what we _do_ have vs. where we're currently falling short.\n1. Get updates: how often working into the night, how often upset about work, how often work demands are clashing with life outside of work. **We don't need details**, especially if trust is low! Just a sense of e.g. how this week compares to last week, and if there are particular things happening that make it worse.\n1. Talk about and get input on long-term fixes. How aware is leadership of what's happening? Share what you've said & heard.\n\n> We have a lot to fix, long-term, but... what _small_ change would make your life just a little bit better, that we can try right now?  \n> Even freeing you from 10 minutes of annoyance gives you 10 minutes to think clearly about larger strategy...\n>\n> Let's assign tasks - I'll do X, you do Y; and we'll review results on the 20th.\n"
