Personal life & relationships suffer. People's careers can stall completely, or if they're still learning, it's by grueling trial & error with little time to reflect... the slowest way.\nt some point, the damage will overwhelm their ability to work at all, and recovery may take months or years.\n\n## How do we talk about it?\n\n1. Define a practical healthy working environment as a reference (mental well-being, flexibility, high-quality work & collaboration, carefully-managed complexity & technical debt), and highlight what we _do_ have vs. where we're currently falling short.\n1. Get updates: how often working into the night, how often upset about work, how often work demands are clashing with life outside of work. **We don't need details**, especially if trust is low! Just a sense of e.g. how this week compares to last week, and if there are particular things happening that make it worse.\n1. Talk about and get input on long-term fixes. How aware is leadership of what's happening? Share what you've said & heard.\n\n> We have a lot to fix, long-term, but... what's a little change that would make your life just a bit better that we can try right now?  \n> Even freeing you from 10 minutes of annoyance gives you 10 minutes to think clearly about the real fixes...  \n> Okay, to be really concrete - I'll do X, you do Y; and we'll check back on the 20th to see how much of a difference it made.\n"
