It helps if we pick a time that's a natural break: near lunch or after stand-up, maybe.\n\nLess frequently than that is risky, though it doesn't _feel_ like a risk.\n\nBut everyone thinks differently, and we can be taken by surprise that someone has been struggling, but didn't think to say anything.\n\n## What about evaluation?\n\nIf part of your job is judging their performance, how do you do that?\n\n**When** do you do it?\n\nYou have to do it, at least a little bit, before every 1-on-1, because it's so much easier to work with someone on a problem when it's minor and you have time.\n\nIf you don't notice it for months, until it's a serious problem... you might cost someone their job and/or a lot of pain.\n"

Suppose they don't find any great options and stay... but I've just picked someone else to lead something new & exciting?\n\nThe best I can do is to make it **valuable** to be open with me.\n\nThis might mean:\n\n1. I can be a strong reference, and can also look for opportunities in my networks\n1. I can help you weigh what's important; compensation vs. mission vs. autonomy vs. work-life integration vs. ...\n1. I can help optimize your CV (logging wins is already helping)\n1. I can be open about upcoming plans & possibilities internally (and whatever decisions we're making that involve you)\n1.

We need our brains for quality work, and brains do not function well in flaming wreckage.\n* Everyone on the team knows what actual value we're creating\n* We experiment & make changes to avoid burning away our energy on anything **else**, like work politics, lost focus, bad communication.\n\nIf we're motivated & focused after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's get her vision updates in a few weeks.\n\nIf we're discouraged & panicked after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's NOT do that; we can stay informed some other way.\n\nIf we're oblivious to whether we'll hit a deadline or not, let's front-load riskier work, invest some time in partial estimates, and make sure it's known.\n\nDoes it work well to have semi-weekly showcases, where we tour through our progress?

Training, help internally or from a consultant, increased timeline for deep dives, hiring?\n\n...All of these need us to be alert, aware, and communicating well. The answers will vary for different teams.\n\n**Deadlines do not change how an effective team operates.** They can be motivational and focus work. They can also guide decisions around technical debt; it can be fine to alternate focused delivery periods with more exploratory and/or refactoring-focused periods.\n\nBut in the end, it's still up to the team to work in a sustainable & effective way."
