More time (and focus) spent on extra documentation just for other to track status is usually tedious.\n\nSo: we'll be really clear on who's using that info (and what they really need) so we never do unneeded tedious work.\n"

Still... if I _know_ a dev is likely to leave soon, it would be so useful...\nHiring & on-boarding a replacement can definitely take longer than their notice period; they could double-down on mentoring now, etc..\n\nBut it's a risk for them to share. Suppose they don't find any great options and stay... but I've just picked someone else to lead something new & exciting?\n\nThe best I can do is to make it **valuable** to be open with me.\n\nThis might mean:\n\n1. I can be a strong reference, and can also look for opportunities in my networks\n1. I can help you weigh what's important; compensation vs. mission vs. autonomy vs. work-life integration vs. ...\n1. I can help optimize your CV (logging wins is already helping)\n1. I can be open about upcoming plans & possibilities internally (and whatever decisions we're making that involve you)\n1. We can coordinate a smooth handover\n1. And no bridges will be burned; it leaves the door open for you to come back, if that's a good option sometime\n\n> I'm really happy with the work you've been doing; and it feels like you're pretty well-placed here for this stage in your career.\n>\n> But listen: I know opportunities can come up, and there may be things you're hunting for that we just can't provide. If you can keep me somewhat in the loop, there's a lot I can do to help out, and it'd make that an easier transition.\n>\n> Also, if you're not looking yet but getting that feeling... let me know. We get wrapped up in everything; if I'm guessing wrong about how you're doing, I won't do stuff I **could** do to help.\n\n## Share context\n\nOne of the reasons people leave is because they don't realize what they're taking for granted, or what's coming up that'll be specifically valuable for them.\n\nThere may also be much more flexibility than they realize; there can be new teams being created soon, new projects coming up, and even roadmap changes that are possible **simply because** enough people want to work on a particular technology or type of project, and it's possible to find the overlap between those interests & the company mission.\n"

Personal life & relationships suffer. People's careers can stall completely, or if they're still learning, it's by grueling trial & error with little time to reflect... the slowest way.\nt some point, the damage will overwhelm their ability to work at all, and recovery may take months or years.\n\n## How do we talk about it?\n\n1. Define a practical healthy working environment as a reference (mental well-being, flexibility, high-quality work & collaboration, carefully-managed complexity & technical debt), and highlight what we _do_ have vs. where we're currently falling short.\n1. Get updates: how often working into the night, how often upset about work, how often work demands are clashing with life outside of work. **We don't need details**, especially if trust is low! Just a sense of e.g. how this week compares to last week, and if there are particular things happening that make it worse.\n1. Talk about and get input on long-term fixes. How aware is leadership of what's happening? Share what you've said & heard.\n\n> We have a lot to fix, long-term, but... what _small_ change would make your life just a little bit better, that we can try right now?  \n> Even freeing you from 10 minutes of annoyance gives you 10 minutes to think clearly about larger strategy...\n>\n> Let's assign tasks - I'll do X, you do Y; and we'll review results on the 20th.\n"

Or they may believe think bosses will only assign them reasonable tasks, so either they _must_ succeed to prove themselves, or they will fail out of adult life.\n\nOthers will just check out. \"There's no way we'll make this deadline... typical. I'm going to just do the minimum to keep my job, and ignore whatever the bosses feel like shouting about today; there's no point.\"\n\n## What's a healthier mental model?\n\nWhether the deadlines are impossible or even _too_ easy & safe, a team still optimizes in the same way:\n\n* Team well-being & good mental health is first. We need our brains for quality work, and brains do not function well in flaming wreckage.\n* Everyone on the team knows what actual value we're creating\n* We experiment & make changes to avoid burning away our energy on anything **else**, like work politics, lost focus, bad communication.\n\nIf we're motivated & focused after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's get her vision updates in a few weeks.\n\nIf we're discouraged & panicked after hearing from the CEO about how crucial this project is, let's NOT do that; we can stay informed some other way.\n\nIf we're oblivious to whether we'll hit a deadline or not, let's front-load riskier work, invest some time in partial estimates, and make sure it's known.\n\nDoes it work well to have semi-weekly showcases, where we tour through our progress? Or does it ...not really speed us up, and just takes too long to prep?\n\nIf we're dragging because no one on the team has deep experience in a required tech, let's find out our options. Training, help internally or from a consultant, increased timeline for deep dives, hiring?\n\n...All of these need us to be alert, aware, and communicating well. The answers will vary for different teams.\n\n**Deadlines do not change how an effective team operates.** They can be motivational and focus work. They can also guide decisions around technical debt; it can be fine to alternate focused delivery periods with more exploratory and/or refactoring-focused periods.\n\nBut in the end, it's still up to the team to work in a sustainable & effective way."

Who feels comfortable telling someone that they're not good enough?\n\nThe important thing here is that this is **not** the judgement we have to make, anyway.\n\nThis is not an evaluation of the person, their worth, and not even of their ability to be a developer, generally.\n\nTo be really clear, I can't even say \"the work you're doing isn't enough\", just that what I'm seeing doesn't match up with what I think the team needs.\n\nThis sounds like it's splitting hairs, but it's important, because we're bad at guessing what other people are thinking.\n\nSo I need to be clear about:\n\n1. What I'm seeing (and how I'm checking it)\n1. Concrete expectations for this role (this should be clear across the organization, not criteria I'm inventing)\n1. (...discussion & filling in context)\n1. Possible paths & next steps\n\n## Some problems have nothing to do with work\n\nPersonal life struggles can overwhelm work in a way people may not even notice.\n\n> How stable is your life outside of work, right now?  \n> The details are none of my business, but if things are rough right now, we can coordinate to try to keep work really stable.\n\n## A good team and good developer can still be a poor match\n\nMaybe their work is great but their communication style keeps upsetting the rest of the team.\n\nMaybe they are incredibly detail-oriented & want everything just right, and the team needs to crank out many experiments, fast (and throw most of them away). Or vice versa.\n\nMaybe the product complexity has grown to a level where they're struggling to work safely.\n\nThese are all cases where there are many paths:\n\n- You may want to improve these skills\n- You can maybe change focus (or change teams) to work the way you prefer\n- The product itself may need arch refactoring and clean-up before more & more devs are forced to drop out\n- Or maybe it's time to start looking for roles elsewhere; and we can plan this out\n\n## Bring context & options, not threats or demands\n\nIf the conversations feels like a power or dominance struggle, that triggers all kind of instincts that will not help.\n\nA manager's job is not to tell team members what to do or keep them in line.\n\nIt's to support them so that, with the team, they can succeed & build good things.\n\nIf I see a problem, I share the context we see with them, they share their side, and then we collaborate to make sure things get better.\n\nIf I suggest one solution, but they say \"no, I really want to just do it this way, and we'll get the result we need\", that's fine.\n\nThey know themselves better than I do. I just need to confirm how we'll confirm.\n\n## Don't forget to leave space to think\n\nIt's highly stressful when work isn't going well. Many people don't give their best replies immediately in a worrying conversation.\n\n> Think about it, both the options we talked about and what I can do to help.  \n> If you have other ideas or suggestions, let me know! We'll make a concrete plan on Friday.\n"
