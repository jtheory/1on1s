# 1on1s
Single page web app with ideas &amp; scripts for tech 1-on-1s.

All topic content is split out into tidy markdown files, so semi-technical folks can contribute by raising a PR, either adding a new topic or updating the ones I have already.

Built with:
* ReactJS (via create-react-app)
* typescript
* yarn (...tried yarn2, but for now that's a bit rough)
* auto-deployed from git & hosted by netlify
